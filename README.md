# hello-world
This is my first real interaction with Github to set up a portfolio for projects that I have done.

A few months into the Covid-19 Pandemic I lost my job in Automotive Sales of almost 10 years. I had just moved into a +230 year old stone cottage, in need of major renovations, with my wife and 1 year old child. This was a change that we had not forseen but it did not take me long to decide that I needed to make a career choice and within 2 weeks I applied to and was accepted into the Cybersecurity undergraguate program at Champlain College, Online. 

I always have had great interest in computers, coding and technology, in general, and yet never took a deliberate approach to making it the foundation for a career. Starting this journey was very exciting for me and nerve racking because I was only able to transfer in 30 credits of my Associate Degree and only had enough in savings to take me so far. 

I spoke with my academic advisor and schedualed 18credit hours per semester and planned on taking on a full schedule during the summer term as well. This pace would allow me to complete the 3 years of coursework needed for the degree program in 1.5years and finish near the end of my savings. 

This brings me to today, where I am halfway through my last semester of college with a 3.988 GPA, one 3 credit course and a capstone class left. With a sense of relief, disbelief and pride I realize that there is more work to be done to increase my marketability. I have spent so much time on my classes, family and side jobs that I had not taken a real moment to create a portfolio of some of the projects that I have worked on so now that I have a little more time in my schedule I have decided to populate this Github repository with what I have produced, been exposed to and am working on. This post was a great first step in becoming familiar with the *markdown sytax* while following along with the quickstart guide.

Thank you for reading my story and I look forward to sharing what I can.
